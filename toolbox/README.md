## Toolbox

Things that may help with network issues.

Very minimal/rough, first pass, all fairly hard-coded. Consider as placeholders.

- echo - run from node, responds with HTTP Request headers

- proxy - proxy server, typescript/node/express, see README.md inside

- vercel-poke (rename!) - minimal Angular HTTP client
